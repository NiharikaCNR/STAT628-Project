The bread was delicious,  the sopressata sandwich was divine, as was the green bean artichoke salad.  I was surprised and disappointed that the salad was not accompanied by 1-2 small slices of the baguette. When asked, the server said I could order a 1/2 loaf of the baguette (which I did), though that ended up being just too much.   Also, I would recommend not slicing the whole 1/2 loaf, rather, just make the single cut and leave it to the customer to tear it apart.... I'm hoping what I brought home will taste as good as those I ate with my salad.  All in all the food was very good and I look forward to returning to test other menu items.",2017/2/16 22:53

I don't get many chances to wake up on a Sunday to gorgeous weather and be able to casually enjoy a small morning snack but for the first time in a long time, I was finally able to do this! No better time spent than at Helena Avenue Bakery. The only way I can describe the vibe here is modern rustic with a cute outdoor seating area that's shaded with umbrellas. A small part of me was making comparisons between this place and Republique in LA which is a huge compliment given all the great things about Republique! The scale of their menu and baked goods are much smaller though but the vibe here still somehow reminds me of Republique. I chose three items to share between 2 people. 
-Matcha Latte - fairly standard, price about what I expect for the size, would recommend getting a hot one
-Blueberry and Lemon scone - I'm not typically a scone persony but I really wanted to try this one out. I wasn't disappointed! Lots of blueberry with a lemony glaze. The scone was flaky on the outside and soft on the inside.
-Peanut and cashew butter with Banana toast - Hands down one of the best nut butter mix spreads I've ever had spread thickly over perfectly toasted sourdough bread. I wonder if they make it in house or if it's bought from somewhere because....I need more of this! The thinly sliced banana pieces cover the entire toast topped with bits of rosemary which just adds that extra flavor kick. As easy as it sounds like it is to make this at home, enjoying the toast here was pretty darn delicious. 

Overall, I'm a huge fan, I would definitely come back if I visited Santa Barbara again. I wish they had a larger variety of baked goods to try!",2018/10/2 3:39

My friend ordered this dish and the pastries are perfectly crispy. Completely inspired me to try to make them at home. Also, everything was perfectly salted, highly appreciated that. I will definitely be back for more. Until then, I'll currently fantasize about the oatmeal raisin cookie I bought to take home. Can't wait to get out of work and have some",2020/1/27 23:04

Plenty of indoor and outdoor shady seating and decent WiFi make this a good place to work. Nice music playing, from Beach House to Grizzly Bear. Great coffee - no pour-overs, but their drip coffee tasted fresh. It's from the Dart Coffee Co. (new to me) - lightly roasted Peruvian beans. Decent value too - I had a coffee, bagel with cream cheese and tomato, and muffin for about $9. Coffee refills are free, so I had a blueberry scone ($4) to go with the second cup ;) I have mixed feelings about their pastries. They all look good, and while the bagel tasted good, the muffin and scone were bland and both were a touch overdone. The muffin was listed as grapefruit poppy seed, and while the texture was good, there was no grapefruit flavor that I could detect. It was a Monday - perhaps an off-day?  Would recommend it for the coffee and ambiance, and I think the bakery side has potential - their baguette sandwiches look great.

I'm also giving Helena Avenue Bakery 5/5 ""green stars"" for social and environmental impact, based on these reasons:
* Their coffee, from Dart, is certified fair trade and organic. 
* They use organic flour for baking, sourced from Central Milling
* They have ceramic cups and plates and metal utensils for eating in-house.
* Items like sandwiches have just a simple paper wrap.
* Even items that come in packaging (like house-made pickles) they have made fairly sustainable choices (cardboard and PET). 
* Cold drinks cups are compostable, although hot cups and lids are not. 
* Water is available in little glass jars. 
* The support some local charities and events such as bike to work day and Heal the Oceans. 

Find out more about green-star ratings at Green Stars Project dot org. 

PS: The address is a bit confusing: if you approach from Anacapa Street, make your way past The Lark and you'll find this bakery next to the SB Wine Collective. They share the same space (so you can have wine with your bagel instead of coffee, if you so wish). It's easier to find if you approach from Helena Avenue.",2017/7/25 21:14

Not only is it in Downtown Santa Barbara, but it is located in the trendy FUNK ZONE close to the wharf. Really, you could start your day here and walk to a whole lot of points of interest from here.

The egg, ham and cheese in a biscuit breakfast sandwich is so hearty and filling that you could split it into two, if you like light breakfasts, and be good to walk around for several hours after.

The biscuit is so buttery and flaky. The pesto sauce was so good. The cheddar was sharp.

The heirloom tomato galette, though not as heavy in the tummy is still large and filling.

They also serve very good espresso coffees and teas.

Outdoor dining was available - when it was allowed. Masks are required.

Street parking is plentiful in the morning, not so much in the afternoon.

Helena Avenue Bakery shares their space with a wine tasting shop. So the space is a bakery in the morning and a wine tasting shop at night. Great concept!

Also, there is a doggie bowl of water provided for your four-legged friends/kids.

The churro donut, pesto asparagus salad, chocolate zucchini bread, peanut brittle cookie, chocolate chunk cookie, espresso, and so on. My all time favorite is probably the chocolate zucchini bread as it is so dense and flavorful while also tasting fresh and light on the digestive tract. The chocolate chunk cookie is a close second.

I haven't had many savory options here as they are pretty darn pricey for the portion size, however the couple I have had have been mighty tasty, fresh, and packed with the perfect combo of flavors. So in a sense, yes it's expensive but you are really getting what you pay for. They have many breakfast options that are served until 11 am then the lunch baguettes and side salads take over. 

Personally, I'd recommend this spot if you are looking for an artisanal breakfast with craft coffee and quality foods and/or sweets. It's also a nice spot for those wine tasting in the funk zone and want a little snack-a-roo between tasting rooms without walking too far and/or eating too much. 

Food is tasty, staff are kind, and the environment is adorable - The only downside to this spot for me is the prices. It would be a full 5 stars in my opinion if things were just a little more affordable. I'd also enjoy if they had a little more lunch options that didn't include so much bread in them or paying $10 for a few bites of delicious greens instead. Wraps would be awesome!

The person taking our order was patient and helpful and the blueberry lemon scone and fresh squeezed OJ was the perfect beginning.

If you are vegan, skip the egg (sub Avo) & skip the feta.  Would recommend they offer some non dairy cheese option here..non dairy feta is wonderful.  
As usual, fantastic lattes with oat milk! 
Great service...many familiar faces.  Thank you Sierra!
They do offer some gluten free sweets like a gluten free brownie (but do not think it is vegan...).  Really encouraging places to offer some gluten free vegan options when they can. 
The breads are amazing.  If you are not strict gluten free, their sourdough is a good option given how sourdough is made. And it is one of the few times, I will skip my usual gluten free needs and dive into their breads.  The sandwiches made on their breads take the idea of a ""sandwich"" and bring it to the next level.  So good.  
Still a local favorite spot mixed with some interesting visitors that have now discovered this treat!

oh by the way if there is a line, it moves fast (usually).

Tip: Order Online for Take Out in advance.  Then stroll to the beach for a nice walk.  Take the route along State street to enjoy some nice window shopping OR go the side street past Lucky Penny & Shopkeepers (great store), then to the beach..just a few blocks away.

I came here on a Sunday morning at around 10:30 and it was PACKED - line was well out the door. I live within walking distance so I turned right back around to go home and placed an online order for pickup ~45 min later. 

We got the elvis style banana bread, wildflower honey ricotta on sourdough toast, and the green eggs and ham on a biscuit. I was most pleasantly surprised by the elvis because it's not something I would have normally ordered but the flavors complemented each other so well and the banana bread itself was great. It was a huge chunk of bread so it was also a more filling dish than I expected. We both loved the ricotta toast, which was light and more dessert like. The sourdough bread was very impressive - very soft on the inside with lots of crunch on the outside. Lastly, the green eggs and ham was great with the green harissa sauce and there was a huge piece of fluffy egg. It's not a sauce I've had before on a breakfast sandwich and I was a fan! Sadly it did not come with a biscuit like the online website says, but brioche instead.

Tuscan Kale Caesar Salad. Their menu is not as extensive compared to other places, but quality over quantity. 

Before you roll your eyes, their rendition of avocado toast was pretty unique and had a couple ingredients not normally added. The sourdough was toasted a bit too long, it was hard to knife through the charred edges. On top you have a delicious spread of Carpinteria organic avocados that held everything together. Slices of cucumber (could do without), a couple of sprouts (gross), and some feta (yummy) are included. For flavor, they add a sprinkle of pepper and sunflower seeds. I also got an egg for $2.

Southern Fried Chicken on brioche (sandwich): this fried chicken sandwich was one of the most unique ones I have ever eaten, if only it was executed properly.. 
The good: brioche (golden and good crumb, grilled so it was toasty); jalape帽o jam (sweet with a nice kick); black pepper bacon (peppery as advertised and extremely crispy)
The ""bad"": the chicken was incredibly crunchy and chicken well seasoned, but unfortunately a bit dry and burnt on some ends. 

I'd still recommend the chicken sandwich but I'd hope this was just an off day and that they don't aways serve burnt fried chicken because all of the other components of the sandwich were fantastic. Another gripe I have is that I ordered 3 spicy versions of the sandwich and none of them were spicy. Didn't go back because we were already on the freeway.

The food was also super super delicious. I shared the SB Farmers Market Bowl and the turkey sandwich with a friend. The bowl was the absolute star of the show (see my picture). I'm not even a big healthy food person, but this bowl was out of this world. The mushrooms were the best part for sure. SO flavorful.

We all shared the ricotta sourdough toast with strawberries for dessert and everyone LOVED it.

It's my favorite breakfast sandwich. Well...this time around I noticed it stopped coming with biscuits so I replaced the brioche with the biscuit expecting it to be the same size it used to be but I realized they packed the sandwiches in these cute cardboard containers instead of sandwich paper. We got to the car and took out the green eggs & ham sandwich, it was super hefty and ginormous! It was literally the size of a burger! This is one of the biggest breakfast sandwich I've ever had, I barely finished it...now it's making me want to go back to sleep as I write this review. This sandwich is probably going to keep me full until dinner. The biscuit was slightly crunchy on the outside but soft and fluffy at the same time. The flavor is always consistent and I really like the green harissa sauce so I always ask for extra. The egg patty was soft but not to the point where it comes apart, it is the main reason why this sandwich is big.

Most places mess up on their chicken sandwiches because they put all the unnecessary sauces on it and the batter to the fried chicken isn't crispy, or no flavor or too much batter, and the chicken is dry. This chicken is juicy, tender, perfect batter where it's the perfect light airy crunch! No sauce sauce is on it, not needed. Fried bacon on top of the fried chicken and the jalape帽o jam sauce (very light) with the brioche bun, is all the flavor it needs!! Bacon is nice and thick. It's not being engulfed with sauce hiding all the imperfection, because it's perfect! The buns is so light and fluffy with the perfect sweetness. 

The challah French toast- perfect sweetness with the honey and the grapefruit is spectacular!!! It's juicy and crunchy. The bread is soooo soft and fluffy. 

Both items were perfectly balanced being able to taste and feel every single flavor and texture. Who created this!? Who are the chefs!? Props!! My new fave spot when I visit Santa Barbara!!

Plants based bowl option is good with mushrooms, saut茅ed Swiss chard and fresh raw spinach.  It needs a touch of something maybe small halved tomatoes or slivers of marinated red bell peppers.   Please know if you are vegan you can sub eggs for avocado but watch how they ring you up.  The Lovely gal timing me up added $3 for avocado  but she fixed it when I pointed it out as a sub.   

Why not five stars:  $1 extra for non dairy milk option.  To many places have up charges for lactose intolerant folks.  Note: Old town Goleta does NOT upcharge for healthy plant based non dairy milks.

The portion was great and the feta, cucumbers with the egg all tasted divine! I absolutely loved the vibes of the place with their live DJ playing some funky beats. Along with our avocado toast, we ordered the Farmer's Market Sandwich on Brioche which came with a thick baked square size farm egg that was pretty great - I loved the cool concept that this sandwich had going on. 

To pair with our food, we got a cappuccino to share that was more on the strong side. However, the coffee went well with the banana bread we ordered as dessert which was wonderfully warmed and as delicious. Unfortunately, the last cinnamon roll sold out when we were about to get one ourselves. I will definitely have to return to have a shot at getting a cinnamon roll to try.

Fluffy, doughy inside, crisp, glaze outside. There has to be some browned butter or grass fed butter involved. So good! The egg is served slightly runny and it's creamy yolk is the perfect compliment to the tomato jam. Heavenly! 

If you want a grown up take on the classic McDonald's Sausage Biscuit. Walk over to Rebar Coffee and Kitchen across the street, order a side of their house made (amazing) sausage patty, then head over to Helena Avenue Bakery and order the Egg & Cheese Biscuit Sandwich. Once you get your sandwich, pry it open, careful not to mess up it's yummy contents and place your Rebar sausage patty inside. Re-wrap and voila!...You have an incredible gourmet, adult take on a childhood favorite! 

I also highly recommend any of their quiches. The crust is legendary! 

Great customer service. Order at the counter and wait for them to call your name or number. Self-serve water, napkins and utensils. Plenty of seating amongst the long farm-style tables and chairs.

The green eggs and ham on brioche is my go-to; it doesn't taste like any old breakfast sandwich because of that delicious green harissa! I didn't like the farmer's market sandwich on brioche because it was really soggy, perhaps from the Swiss chard. 

For a sweeter option, the Elvis is my favorite hefty, rich treat. Who knew that banana bread, peanut butter, bacon, and honey would go so well together?

Helena Avenue Bakery was the first place we went upon arrival and the last place we visited before our drive back, and I think we stopped by once or twice in between as well.

Some of my favorite menu items from all of those visits:
-Avocado Toast
-Turkey Sandwich
-Kale Caesar Salad
-Homemade Potato Chips
-Hummus and BabaGhanoush

We also purchased some fresh sourdough and country seed bread loaves to-go.  (They will slice it if you ask as long as it's not so early that it's too warm out of the oven to do so).  My kids had their donuts but didn't love them... I think they looked better than they tasted.  I also had a fabulous Americano with almond milk.

Shout-out to Lauren who didn't lose her cool as my husband and I visited first thing on a Sunday before our drive back home and kept adding on to our order.  First it was just coffee and bread, then we decided we needed a sandwich and salad for the road, then we ordered donuts, chips, hummus, etc... Thanks Lauren!

But as I was walking to explore nearby shops in this trendy area, I saw people walking out with coffees and baked goods. 
So down this little side street I went and found this cool bakery. It was an unassuming space that was converted from a factory or warehouse. Lots of tables inside and out. 
I ordered the avocado toast at the counter and took a seat in their cute partially shaded patio. It was mashed avos on a really thick 2"" piece of bread topped with sprouts crumbled feta, sunflower seeds and light seasoning. I know it doesn't sound too exciting but it was one of the best avo toast I've had...thus this long review. The bread was slightly crunchy but soft as you bite into the seemingly-way-too-big toast. It was filling and satisfying. I would have bought some other baked goods to go but they were closing before I had a chance. Get there before 2pm ya'll. Definitely coming back for more.",2021/8/14 1:04

Cool interior and a great selection of actual breakfast items and pastries. Plus, I'm a stickler for hot coffee and there regular drip was great. The first day, we had the ham and cheese croissant, the quiche and a peach tart of some sort. We each had our favorites, but mine was definitely the peach tart. The peaches were so fresh, crust so flaky it was perfect. The second day, my friend got the quiche again and I had their everything bagel with cream cheese and added tomato+capers+red onion pairing for only $2.50 more which I thought was reasonable. While the bagel was more on the flat, airy side instead of think and chewy like the east-coast bagels I like, it was still insanely delicious.

We ordered, found a seat, and then when we got our food - the muffin we ordered didn't arrive. When we went back to the cash register, the woman said they ran out... but it was in display when we ordered. We figured, since it's a bakery, that more would be made? She seemed unordered and just said they ran out. She asked if we wanted a refund, but we had to go back to our table and get the card we paid with. Upon returning, had to wait in line again to get the refund. It was kinda frustrating bc we had to do this before eating our food. Also, hard to find clean utensils.

Upon leaving, I remembered that this spot was within a block of the pier. After hearing several of my friends rave about this place, I figured now was as good a time as any to give 'em a try!

It was just past 7am when I walked in. There was one couple seated, but the kitchen was teeming with staff baking away! What a cool sight! The restaurant appears to be shared with a winery; the venue was spacious and well-decorated! Though there only appeared to be a few dedicated parking spaces, I had no trouble finding a spot close by. 

The staff were friendly and the menu was vast. I ordered a mocha and the ricotta toast and they were both out of this world. The mocha was one of the best I've ever had, and the toast had the perfect blend of sweet and savory  atop a hearty slab of bread! They went together so well. What a treat!

Today was my first time here but certainly not my last. I've attempted to come in the past only to be greeted by a line out the door. As I was leaving, a group of 10 walked in. The place is totally worth the line, but be like me and come super early to avoid it!",2020/1/19 0:42

While I was trying to figure out what to order the girl at the counter gave me some suggestions as I didn't know what I wanted to order. I ended up going with an Iced Chai Latte and the whipped ricotta and seeded honey combo toast.

The Iced Chai was delicious as always! Came out first which was nice. They soon brought my toast over and I fell in love with it. I loved the whipped ricotta and seeded honey toast!! It was SO delicious! I don't know why I never had tried this earlier. The toast had the perfect amount of cheese and honey. The ricotta tasted so fresh probably was the best I've ever had. I love the seeds in the honey as well. I'm going to ask them next time I go what kind of seeds they are so I can try to make this kind of honey at all.

Everytime I come here I always have an amazing experience! Great service and delicious food! What else do you need?  I can't wait to come back soon to try the cinnamon toast as I've been told it's as amazing as the ricotta toast! :)",2018/10/12 21:18
