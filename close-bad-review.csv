bi6GaeWDGceGv62lXTIKQA,RgtbLaiU22zqaCk20HgbiQ,bjhCtlYHrkgA5Ku8l-rB3g,1,1,0,0,"Very disappointed. We went to eat  at 2:15 on Saturday and were told the kitchen closed at 2. Their website says: Sat & Sun all day. Their website claims that they are open until 5.
I'm always a bit suspect of places that can't manage simple details like their hours on their website. It makes me wonder about the awareness to quality and other ""small"" items.",

Basically, the food is mediocre, which is fine, I can handle so-so tasting food. It's the experience portion of dining here that caused such a low review. I saw the good and bad reviews, but I'm fair and like to judge from my own experience, so I came in with neutral expectations. I came in with a group of six people. We ordered separately, I was the first to order. However, our food took 25 minutes, and when we asked what the holdup was, no one seemed to know or care. We did end up letting them know the service was poor, and the guy I was explaining to walked away as I was speaking! He flat out did not care.  At this point, that's just plain rude. We tried to complain to the woman managing the floor and her response was, ""oh.""  Apparently, we weren't the only ones complaining, as we were walking out, another customer walked in to get her money back because her boyfriend has already been served and finished his food while she still hadn't gotten hers. This place has potential, but until they realize that service is an equally important part of the restaurant experience, they probably won't even try to improve. Such a bummer.",
lvenNxO98GCywBqGpoOVOg,xXpXyf7TLV_xvtDYk4kW8g,bjhCtlYHrkgA5Ku8l-rB3g,1,1,0,0,Terrible service.  I ordered take out and after 25 minutes I had to cancel my order.  I got my money back but what the hell?  It wasn't even busy.  I was watching them as the food came out of the kitchen and neither the kitchen staff nor the people serving had any idea what was going on.  Everyone looked clueless.  I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that my food never appeared.,

My friend loves the little olive rolls. But for me, I chose a medium sized hunk of ciabatta. It was soft and squishy, just like I like it! My friend's kids split the chocolate brioche torpedo. For me, it was really dry and flavorless. It was the chocolate that made it palatable.",

When I placed my order ~Cubano sandwich, with wheat&walnut, cranberry bread.....only that (my favorite) bread was not available. iI almost walked out. I should have.
It took  f o r e v e r   to get my  sandwich, it was 'eh, just not the same yummy taste,  salad was smaller and if I'm correct, it cost $2 more than at at old location!
So, I'll give ODB a 2 out of a 10. 10 being the best. Sorry guys, but you gotta step it up!

Terrible place to sit on the corner of De la Vina and Alamar. The food was a bit overpriced and it took 25 minutes to get an omlet. There was no service. Cute orange chairs though and a good local brand.,

When I went there today, I had to drive back and forth 3 times before I could find a parking space. When you get inside, there's a tiny sign on the cash register that tells you where there is a parking lot, but you still have to ask where it is. I wasn't even sure I could find anywhere for myself or the 2 people with me could sit - we managed to grab the last spot while we looked at menus - if we waited, it would have been gone and we would have been eating at the counter, I guess, since the staff wasn't even paying attention to how much seating there was and just kept taking orders.  I went to stand in line to order. While I was in line (next up to order) some people walked up and stood on the other side of the person ordering while I was standing there waiting - and the staff began taking their order, ignoring me. In short, no place to park your car or your butt and the staff seriously needs to pay attention. Won't be going back.",

XKYaSeMMIxObKfJVEq4NWg,tPOnkiw7ifTTI-ojbV4MYA,bjhCtlYHrkgA5Ku8l-rB3g,2,1,0,0,"stopped by hoping to find a selection of breads of different grains and found the basics. The place was stuffy, employees looked war-weary and indifferent, the outside dining was BORING and the tables are cheap n ugly. Certainly not the experience I hoped for given that this was such a hip, happening place downtown. 
I must say that I didn't end up eating here -- nothing in the display cases looked of exceptional quality so I passed. I suppose the menu items might be good but I doubt I'll go back to find out. The place is just plain, old not inviting. Sorry ODB mgmnt/owner",
BiKyC-r9T4V0CO72b8yJDw,Ft4t7m1COMYKGHP3HF-A6Q,bjhCtlYHrkgA5Ku8l-rB3g,1,4,3,1,"We live in the neighborhood and were excited to be able to walk over for Sunday breakfast.  The restaurant was not busy, yet the tables were not bussed and were dirty.  We ordered and sat outside, and even the manager walked by without thinking to clean our dirty table, until we asked him over to do so (and to clean the one next to us so we didn't have to look at it too).

We ordered Spinach Eggs Benedict, yet were told that they were out of spinach.  They offered to substitute zucchini, which we accepted - yet had to look hard for when it came.  The hollandaise was more like a mayonnaise without any true flavor.  And while it was good that they didn't overcook the egg so the yolk would still be runny - they way undercooked it, with parts of the white still uncooked.  Yuck.

We were thinking to point that out to them, but there was a definite sense that no one who worked there would have even cared enough.

We also ordered huevos rancheros which was quite under-seasoned and bland. 

We bought a loaf of gluten-free bread to take home, and were seriously unimpressed - threw it away after eating less than half.

The inside atmosphere was fun, with the bright metal and orange colors, yet outdoor seating begs for more plants to hide and soften the boring and busy street corner the restaurant is on.

Come on Our Daily Bread!  Step it up and care!",
APeHGEkKBLli852unSbNuw,Y_gVr5WOMoTX6osc4rRJHg,bjhCtlYHrkgA5Ku8l-rB3g,2,0,0,0,"It was nice that they offered a veggie benedict and that they offered it on top of gluten free toast. However, when I think of benedict I think smothered in hollandaise and perfectly poached eggs. This place did neither. The eggs were overcooked so that the yolk was hard, the pesto hollandaise sauce was not impressive and they put only a small amount on top of each egg (it wasn't even enough to cover the egg). Maybe I just ordered that wrong thing, but I am not really inclined to go back.",

Our breakfasts were extremely unremarkable--the french toast was thin and served with only a small amount of syrup, the scrambled eggs were blah as was the turkey bacon. And, they charge at least 30% more than other restaurants in town that serve better food.  We do not mind paying more, providing that the quality is there. ODB needs to check out their competition for value and quality. We will not be back. Not worth it! I really hate to give negative reviews, but they could do so much better.",

It took 30 min to get our food, and he was given the wrong sandwich! Not to mention, each panini cost about $10 and was so not worth it -- I ordered a roast veggie panini with goat cheese, and there was barely any goat cheese on the sandwich, like 1/2 an ounce tops!

I am giving them three stars due to the utterly disappointing portions. I took the advice of the woman at the counter who suggested a small Cobb salad as a great lunch option. Considering it was $9 I figured  it couldn't be that ""small"". My salad was tiny! My stomach was growling 30 mins later :( .My poor boyfriend got the tri tip sandwich and ended two itty bitty pieces of meat and tomatoes ( which he said he didn't even want on there).

I will admit their employees were friendly and the breads look great. They may just need to work on getting the price down and the portions up. South coast deli provides much better food at similar costs right down the st.",

Sucks because it used to be so good when they first sprouted up on De La Vina; and I will miss so  many things that used to be be delicious.

Go to pick it up...no salsa in my to go box. Ask and the clerk says they don't have salsa, only pico de gallo. That's fine with me, just as good.  I stand there for awhile waiting for my pico, only to find out, its not even made! I would have to wait longer while the kitchen staff chops it all up in between trying to keep up with other orders. This is a historical problem for this place, leaving ingredients I have paid for off my plate without apology or even care.

Even following them from their move to this location our family has been buying bread and pastry from Our Daily Bread for many years. 

Not any more!  

Over the past few weeks, the quality of their products has declined dramatically.  The cases are clearly filled with at least day-old products - choose carefully and look for volume so you can be assured that the breads/pastries were baked recently.  We have found that there are only a few types of bread/pastries in any quantity on the shelves - and if there are only a few left, they are clearly older than a day or two.   Their bread stales quickly so beware.  Shouldn't bakeries clearly label and at least discount day+ old products?

Last week we purchased a few croissant, pastries, breads for a party. The croissants were deformed, oily (where's the butter?), dense, tough and heavy - the baker clearly has no concept of what a real one even looks like, let alone tastes.   Ditto the pastries - Costco does it better!  After a bite or two, we tossed all of them. 

The counter staff is still hard working and charming, but we will be taking our business elsewhere.
