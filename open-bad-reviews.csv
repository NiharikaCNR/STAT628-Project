So I ordered an espresso drink to go. I waited 15 minutes for that drink! Why only one barista on a busy Saturday morning? The owners should re-open Lucky Penny for breakfast because Helena Bakery is busier than they can handle (and I want my wood-fired eggs!)

We were the only ones waiting for food. It took them 15 minutes to toast a mediocre bagel and put it in a box with capers, cream cheese, and onions, pre-packaged separately based on the 5 days prior date scrawled in sharpie on the plastic cup (they forgot my tomatoes). Not very cute for the mom-and-pop vibe they have going.

Barista was fast at least. Good latte and cold brew. I should have just ordered a pastry though.",2018/3/4 17:37

I especially miss the wood fired eggs and financiers. Every time we order for here, they give us our drink in to go cups and it takes a long time to get the drinks.

The counterperson was very accommodating when asked if I would like to order breakfast at 5 to 11.  I did and he asked the chefs not to put the breakfast acudaments away.  Very kind and great service.

 I was terribly excited to meet my husband for brunch during the work week but was slightly disappointed with my order.  Being vegetarian I thought I might try the biscuit egg dish without the egg and enjoy the tomato jam.  It was over cooked, could hardly bite into the biscuit and the jam far too sweet.  

Oh well, perhaps I will just have coffee next time because that was delicious.",2017/8/8 22:39
4YAj-NY_uP6J9I28bbCXaQ,0CUDrMaBZaQUU0xX0fYRpA,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,2,2,0,0,I had really high expectations for this bakery since I'm a pastry chef myself. They seem like they are going for more of a wholesale bakery rather than retail since the show case was rather sad. We arrived at 10:45 on Sunday but there was no sign of life. We thought they were closed but we asked a chef who was just arriving to work and he said they opened at 11.....kind of odd for a bakery. We had the blueberry hand pie. It was good but probably not worth $6.50.  No espresso drinks but they had drip coffee. We will come back again in the future when they aren't so new.,2016/7/18 2:41

Asked if they could slice a few pieces of the bread and bag the rest of the loaf.  We were told no, we only use the loaf slicer.  There was a bread  knife about 2 inches from the loaf rack.  We ordered  an olive loaf and when we opened the bag inside was a walnut loaf.  Glad we were not allergic to nuts.  They were not busy,  just careless.",2017/3/23 18:40

Above all else the acme hospitality group knows how to create a trendy yet not over the top vibe and provide a welcoming warm atmosphere in any of there locations. Outside seating is great. And I felt like I could sit and hang out with out taking up too much space. 
I came In to Helena ave really wanting to love it.   
The service was friendly although very slow.   There was a pretty long line though so I know the girl felt flustered and it didn't bother me too much.   
I ordered the quiche, and it was cold. The  assumed eggs would come warmed but you know what assuming does I guess.  
So I Waited in line again to ask have it heated.  And when I got it back the temperature had barely risen. In fact I think she put it in the fridge for a minute not the oven.   It still cold.  Who wants to eat cold eggs!?! 
ThAt was a bummer.   Flavor wasn't bad. Although not bad is still not great.   
I didn't try any coffee.  
Maybe being a bakery I should have gone with a pastry? Oh well.",2017/3/8 18:05

xHjevPWZHKwmYt0Z0eIjEg,ke0wwp9Dx5CVUWP18keLag,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,3,0,0,0,We had a cinnamon roll and chocolate croissant here. The service at the counter was harried and sloppy although polite. The two people in front of me were visibly frustrated for different reasons (one ordered takeout and got their order on a plate and one had been waiting a while for their coffee and the wrong drink was made). Our pastries were good but not outstanding. The cinnamon roll had a ton of sweet icing without a taste of creamcheese (I think it was a sugar icing). And not a lot of cinnamon taste either. Croissant was good but standard.,2017/7/7 1:39

Totally understand a kitchens need to change over but perhaps offer the simple granola with yogurt or create a breakfast ""flavored"" baguette to help out the late morning arrivals?? Maybe a fruit and yogurt parfait in the cold case??? Even on weekends if you spent the night out in the funk zone and return the next day in hopes of revitalizing only to be faced with a salad or sandwich at 11:02 am? Honestly it was 11:02. I would have rushed over had I known that s BAKERY would stop serving brekkie at 11:00. Who knew? Well I guess I do now. 
Suggestions to HSB.... help with the transition! I stood at the counter watching what I wanted to order be handed to the person who ordered 3 minutes earlier than me. OUCH! 
Even granola on yogurt would have earned you an extra star from this reviewer. A 3 minute exception to your hard an fast rule would have earned you 2 more stars despite the food only being a 4. Your staff is lovely. They must cringe when the clock strikes 11:00 knowing they can't bend to any pleading a customer might attempt.

#NAME?,uXjdbiJ8L9WyX2CKZK5Bsg,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,3,0,0,0,Sad to see they changed so many great parts of their menu. No more cinnamon rolls or donuts now it's just a sugar coated morning bun. And adding bacon to their egg and tomato biscuit sandwiches was really not necessary they were good before. The first time I ordered 2 and realized that there was bacon in them I drove back and asked them to remake it and when I checked them again the egg they put inside was so tiny and thin I literally thought it wasn't in there and drove to the store to buy eggs just so it could have more filling! Disappointed in the menu changes but may still go back for other menu items.,2017/11/18 19:55

TkJAXxeXxk1cv_aVfNdzUw,GjSaefh6mxCErvThiOQWpw,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,2,0,0,0,"So I live in Santa Barbara and have visited the bakery on multiple occasions, always walking away unimpressed and slightly irritated. This morning was no different. Sunday at 9 AM, no line yet, and I asked if the egg and cheddar biscuit could be made with sourdough instead, (I was looking at the shelves loaded with their sourdough loaves), but I got an unapologetic ""no, the kitchen doesn't do that"" response. Strike 1. Next, my friend ordered a bagel with cream cheese and tomato slices, and was sorely disappointed in the measly portion of 3 tiny slices of ""crisp"" and utterly flavorless Roma tomatoes that were given. For their prices, one should be getting organic tomatoes, or at least larger, juicier, higher-quality ripe tomatoes. Strike 2. My son and I waited a solid 15 minutes for our egg sandwiches to come out, and watched as others who came in after us received their orders well before us. When we did get the sandwiches, we had to do a careful investigation to find the egg. We had ordered scrambled, and upon close inspection under the ""hood"" we finally found it: the thinnest ""patty"" of egg I have ever encountered, barely to be tasted within all the brioche bun. My 7-year old asked, ""Where's the egg?"" and I should have brought it back up to the manager to show what was actually coming out of the kitchen for $8.  Strike 3. The croissant my daughter ordered was not flaky or fresh (Renaud's is infinitely better) and she left a lot of it on her plate (something she never does). It's too bad, because the location is good, atmosphere OK, and their bagels better than most in the area (lots of chew and tug, hearty). Unfortunately, Helena Ave Bakery won't be seeing us around again, unless we stick to ordering bagels to go.",2017/10/29 23:37

1. The system for getting your food is horrible.  They yell your name and put the food on top of a pastry display case.  Clueless tourists will push you and step on your feet, as you try to get through to pick up your food, so be very careful.

2. The bread is excellent, but the cooked food is not hot.  Cold egg sandwiches and lukewarm latte are unacceptable.

3. Don't wear sandals or other open toed shoes at the inside tables.  I almost sliced my foot.  The clamps that keep the wheels on the tables from moving are knife sharp.  They need to be wrapped with insulation or removed completely.

I had the market salad and my husband had the hot chicken sandwich.  We also got a lemon blueberry scone to share.  The scone was good, on the sweeter side.  The hot chicken sandwich was decent, but not our favorite of various sandwich places around.  My market salad was incredibly disappointing - only had radish and pickled celery in it for $13.  Seems like it may be better for breakfast or just drinks or bakery items.

The one really nice thing was we had our toddler with us and they brought us out some chicken for her for free since they didn't want her to eat the spicy chicken my husband had.

lh1ZTabhJrJ5WOwbcHMBFA,B5s_DCLVrBLrL8U6TEVlwA,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,3,5,2,2,"Bottom Line:  Very expensive but good food

Like a lot of places in the Funk Zone, this place is kitschy, filled with hipsters from LA and very expensive.

I have to say right off the bat that the food was good - we defiantly enjoyed it.    The thing is, it was so expensive that I'll never be back.  I love riding in new Mercedes but I would never own one as I simply cant justify the cost when I can have something else for 1/4 the price that is essentially the same and its gets me where im going in similar comfort.

We got the Burrata sandwich which was $15.....um, what?  $15 for bread, cheese, bacon - and it was delicious but $15?  Frankly, I resent the normalizing the $15 sandwich.  $10-$12 is already pushing it for some of our local hero sandwich shops and those are almost certainly good for two meals and I'm 6 foot 3.

We also got soup and a pastry.  Our bill with tip came out to more than $30

We also got there almost exactly when they opened and my wife had to fight to keep our seats as I had to go change our daughter diaper.  People - quite rudely actually - kept trying to physically take our seats as they we not occupied by humans but by our things as we were going to come back.  I get the feeling had we all gone to the bathroom at the same time, our things would have just been tossed onto the floor.

Lets not even discuss the parking situation.

Honestly, the LA hipsters can have this place.  It's good but not good enough to justify the cost or the trouble",2019/12/10 20:40

There were several different breakfast sandwiches on the menu. We were looking for just a quick bit. Simple pastries, donuts etc. The place calls itself a bakery, so I assumed the croissants, pastries, and donuts would be very fresh. This was not the case. I had a ham & cheese croissant, which was ok, but not that fresh, flakey etc. My daughter ordered the ""seasonal donut"" which was $4.00. It was just an iced cake donut with colored sprinkles. Nothing more than you'd find at a cheap donut place for $1.00 or less. My wife had a blueberry danish. Again, it was OK, but not great. This place says it is a bakery. Am I wrong for assuming the baked goods would be fresh and better than average? If you're going to charge me $4.00 for a donut, it better be the best darn donut I ever ate.

PJQkFOalE8aEexb9xiL3Zg,Xp5Hj2SGl0eDp3Ine9a_vg,IDtLPgUrqorrpqSLdfMhZQ,1,15,0,0,"This is a tough review to write, because I have been a devoted take-out customer of Helena Avenue Bakery since they opened. I live nearby, so I go in at least weekly and buy loaves of bread, biscuits and pastries. On Mother's Day, I even asked for their special breakfast of a biscuit with berries and cream, which my husband got to go. In fact, the day before this awful customer service experience, I had purchased over $45 in loaves of bread to take home. 

This past weekend was the first time I ever ordered drinks and sat down at a table to eat in. My husband and I took out-of-town friends for a special breakfast and it turned out to be a fiasco. The bakery was not crowded when we arrived on Friday morning. At the counter, the cashier (a 30-something brunette, who seemed to be the manager), was speaking over the customer in front of her, to a woman walking away, ""Would you like to register a complaint with the owner?"" The woman kept walking away and the cashier/manager turned to the customer in front of her and said: ""Nothing like a customer complaint when you're already having a shitty day."" She went on to complain about everything that went wrong with opening the shop that day before she took her order. My guest and I looked at each other and shrugged it off, since I had had so many positive experiences with take-out orders. 

We went outside and got a table and waited for the other two in our party to arrive. Later, the four of us went up to order. One of our party was a little picky - wanting to know what was in the green harissa, and that was met with some aggressive eye-rolling from the young man helping us. Finally, our order was placed. We sat on the patio and discovered there wasn't a pin to hold up the umbrella and it was starting to heat up. I went back up and waited in line to ask for a pin for the umbrella. The young man rolled his eyes again and said he'd look for it. Our iced teas were up on the bakery counter, so I took those and sat back down. I sent my husband up to get his coffee, which wasn't on the counter, and perhaps the pin for the umbrella, if the young man had located it. Ten minutes later my husband came back with his coffee and all our meals, which were wrapped in to go paper. One was a salad, so that was a mess. 

I went up and waited in line again to get plates, silverware and napkins for us all. There appeared to be plates in the self-serve area under the silverware, but went I bent down to get some, I noticed half the plates had bread crumbs and spilled milk on them. Half seemed clean and half seemed dirty, so I waited in line again to ask for plates. This time, the blonde barista waited on me and I asked for plates. She told me to get them in the area under the silverware, and seemed irritated when I told her half the plates there had milk and crumbs in them. She left and came back with 4 saucers. I asked her if there were no clean dinner plates and she rolled her eyes at me and said she'd see. 

Then, I stood there while she made 2 coffee orders, waiting. After she placed those orders on the counter, she looked at me and said, ""Oh yeah, plates."" She then went over to the kitchen area to a stack of plates. She picked up one and then another. She wiped crumbs off the 2nd and 4th plates with her hands and brought me a stack of 4 and aggressively asked, ""Are THESE big enough for you?"" I ignored the crumbs I had seen her brush off and said, ""Perfect. Thanks!"" 

Over the course of breakfast, which everyone thought tasted delicious, my male guest went back inside three different times and fetched iced tea refills for three of us in our party. When we left, we cleaned up after ourselves and put our dirty plates in the tubs provided. I stopped by the barista and asked her for some more iced tea and she sneered at me: ""Sorry. We don't provide free tea refills."" I said to my friend: ""I didn't realize you were paying for all those refills everytime you went back inside and got them. Thank you so much."" My friend said: ""I didn't. They were free."" He nodded to the same blonde female barista who had sneered No Free Refills at me and said: ""She gave them to me free."" 

So, if you are a handsome man, you'll get clean plates and free iced tea refills, but if you're a middle-aged, heavy-set female who drops about $50 a week in the establishment, be prepared to get dirty plates, a big sexist and ageist attitude and treated like shit. I've dropped my last dollar in this establishment and will be taking my business to the excellent D'Angelos Bakery, where their baked goods are cheaper and just as good, their breakfast menu has more than a couple of choices, their parking isn't a battle with day drinkers in the funk zone, and their staff doesn't treat customers with disdain, like weekend tourists they'll never see again.

The morning bun was not just-out-of-the-oven fresh and for $5 was basically a rip-off.  Morning buns need to be made in small batches and sold within a couple of hours of baking.  Ours was air-stale, hard, dry, and unappealing.

The $10 'green egg' (green harissa) biscuit overall was pretty good but the egg inside was not (allowed to spread too thin when being fried and thus much of it was cooked to a dry, paper thin crisp disc).  I suggest these folks take a field trip up to Pine State Biscuits in Portland, OR to see a better product being served at a better price.

While I appreciate having a nice presentation it seemed a little ridiculous to have three people not wearing gloves reorganize the dish while I stood there and watched.  Finally after the 25 minutes of charcuterie design I brought the cheese plate to my table.  It came with a ramekin full of seven almonds and no crackers.  Since we wanted something crunchy to go with our cheese I walked back up to the counter to ask for more almonds to which they told me I could NOT have extra.

I ordered a little strawberry custard pastry and took a chance on their tea-making skills. My husband opted for a drip coffee.

It's a really lovely setting, and you can see into the kitchen inside. Friendly service. Most everything you need (water, stir sticks, sugars, etc) are all accessible and they give you a number to take to your table.

We sat outside with our pastries and my tea came out within a few minutes. It's a loose leaf blend. As far as I could tell it was good quality tea... but they served a miniscule amount in a huge bowl of a cup. Like, less than a teaspoon full. So even after leaving it to infuse for a long time there was barely any color or flavor to it. I couldn't be bothered to chase it up so I just drank it. The rule of thumb is 1 teaspoon per cup, plus one for the pot. Obviously this wasn't in a pot but a heaping teaspoon is still required for a regular cup, so a big mug like this could use 2.

The pastry was heavier than it looked, more like a cinnamon roll with custard and strawberry than a butter pastry. It was nice, a good size, fresh fruit, not too sweet. 

Really lovely setting and overall a decent experience, but it did fall below my expectations a little bit. I know tea is tricky but if you're making the effort to serve a nice loose leaf, it's worth serving it correctly.",2019/11/26 17:59

We were staying in the area and had heard about this bakery which was known for some great breakfast sandwich items so we stopped by. We ordered the breakfast sandwich and the crispy chicken sandwich.

Breakfast sandwich: 3/5
Reading the reviews I was excited to try it. As the reviews mention the egg is perfectly soft. What I found lacking was any flavor. The brioche bread was not as buttery or sweet as others I have had and I was just expecting more.

Chicken sandwich: 4/5
After taking my first bite I was underwhelmed but realized what the problem was. The bacon is too chewy and distracts from the perfectly crisp on the outside and tender on the inside chicken. So I removed the bacon and took my second bite and loved the sandwich. I would order the chicken sandwich with the bacon on the side. I wish the bacon pieces were thinner and crispier.",2022/1/6 5:20

One suggestion for a more efficient way to make coffee and get it out to your customers is not to fill up multiple to go orders before bringing them out to the customers.   By the time I was able to enjoy my first sip it was luke warm.  Will not be coming back to this place ever again!,2021/11/27 17:36

I got the BLT, which while having a delicious combination of thick bacon, sweet tomatoes, and cheese, was ruined by two slices of sourdough bricks. The bread had been nearly saturated with butter then over toasted, making it as rough as sandpaper. I had to stop eating the bread half way through.  When I got back to my hotel, I pressed a white towel against the roof of my mouth and it was spotted with blood",2021/9/20 21:11

She asked if I had any allergies and explained what the sandwich came with. Today, April 2 came back for breakfast before I headed back home and the male Caucasian cashier not helpful at all. I let him know I wanted to order my San the way I ordered it yesterday and his reply was ""I WASNT HERE YESTERDAY!"" You kidding me??? What a yerk! He didn't bother asking or helping out. Last time I come here. He needs customer service training. If he were to be fired I'd come back. Great spot but awful service from this cashier.",2021/4/2 18:36

After 40 mins we asked about our food, it was sitting out (for how long we don't know). They said it would be right out. After 10 mins nothing. Went back in, food still sitting there looking horrible and congealed, they still wanted to serve it to us, so we asked for a refund. Couldn't understand why the staff would let it sit there as other food was going out. Tables were dirty, we asked twice to have it cleaned.

I reached out to Helena Ave Bakery SEVERAL times to set up a catering order for the morning of my wedding so my bridesmaids and I would have coffee & breakfast. We were getting ready blocks away so it seemed like the perfect idea since I've tried their coffee & food before and really liked it. I called a few times over several weeks and kept being told the manager would call me back. They NEVER called me back. I even emailed 3-4 times and never received a response back. This is completely unacceptable service. Luckily we went with a different bakery in town. DO NOT USE HELENA AVE BAKERY FOR CATERING/GROUP ORDERS.",2021/11/1 19:23

We LOVE their food and location however the management needs major organizational skills and HELP!!! From the single cashier which made our wait longer than necessary (30 minutes just to order) to the fact that they got our order wrong and then when we tried to correct our order after waiting for 50 minutes, they sold out of the item we originally ordered! Also when we were finally able to order we were told that after waiting 30 minutes in line we had to take our food to go because there weren't any tables available we pointed out that some of the tables were leaving shortly  and they told us that we could not have those tables and the people behind us had priority over those tables.

Wouldn't order it again.  Also took forever to get our food...it wasn't busy so that wasn't the reason.

Portion size was also small especially considering the prices were pretty expensive for just sandwiches with no sides.

Service was friendly and they had a nice, funky space.  Hoping they can expand their options...maybe add a couple pieces of fruit to go with each breakfast option???",2018/9/21 23:24
