I loved the hint of the lemon because it wasn't too overwhelming and the maple syrup was really good too! I also ordered the hot chocolate and it was delicious. I am very picky about my hot chocolate and it was just right! My only confusion was where to put my dishes once I was done but I asked an employee and he was very kind and told me to leave them on the table. Go try it everyone!,2013/5/7 16:31

First of all, they put amazing samples of breads with olive oil and aged balsamic vinegar.  I could craze along the counter all day, and be a very happy man.  I have to say that their olive bread is to die for.  After loading up on the carbs, you are ready for something refreshing.  The salads are beyond exceptional.  The ingredients are dripping with freshness, and feels like farm to table while you wait.  If you are looking for a sandwich, the Cubano is just the ticket.  The first time I went in, I asked the cashier what she recommended because I was having a hard time deciding.  She told me that her favorite, without a doubt, was the Cubano.  So, I gave it a shot.  Now, I need my fix at least once a week.  I think there is an addictive agent in that sandwich.  It's probably in the bread - ya know, the bread that they have calling and enticing you from the top of the display case like a seductress.  Oh, did I fail to mention that once they get you in their grip, you're soon turned onto the pastries and goodies in the display case???  They have so many to choose from, and each one looks delectable.  They even have vegan and gluten free, which I was skeptical about, but very happily surprised.  I would be totally neglectful if I didn't mention the AWESOME staff.  They are genuine, fun, and really ensure that you have a positive experience.  No matter what mood you walk into Our Daily Bread in, you leave in a great mood.  So, if you need/want a new addiction in your life and to be treated like the most important person around, Our Daily Bread is a stop for you.",2014/4/3 21:59

I had just been in San Francisco and had crazy good toast at The Mill. There's really no one doing toast in So Cal except for here. Huge thick pieces of toast served with fresh ground peanut butter and homemade strawberry preserves. Seriously - this whopping piece of toast was enough for 2 people. 

I know they supply a number of local restaurants with their bread but it's great to stop in here and pick up a loaf for yourself at home. In the mornings, they often have a selection of their fresh loaves cut up for you to sample. Fantastic!!",2015/6/12 3:18

I was up in Santa Barbara the other day and we noticed this Cafe as we drove around.

The next day when we wanted to go out for breakfast I went to YELP to read the reviews.

Its rating was good enough for us to go try it and we are so happy we did.
Though I will say this place is better then its  current rating of 3.5 stars.

We almost turned around  and left when we first got there because the menu posted on the front door said that breakfast was only served until 11 AM and it was 11:10 when we got there.   Fortunately I walked inside and asked the gentlemen behind the counter if we could still get breakfast.  He informed me that  BREAKFAST IS SERVED ALL DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Those are my five favorite words in the world at a Restaurant as breakfast is my favorite meal of the day.

I ordered a 3 egg omelette with the breakfast potatoes and sourdough toast. 
My friend had the Breakfast Burrito.  They were both FABULOUS!  The omelette was light and fluffy.  They do not chince on the ingrediants I had plenty of tomatos in my omelette.  The breakfast potatoes were delish.  

We ordered a cup of  coffee and that was also outstanding.  They give you a cup and its self serve.  I love that.  They have plenty of options for things you can add to your coffee such as Cinnamon, Nutmeg, Chocolate powder.  You can also order Espressos and other coffees that they prepare for you.

Even though we were stuffed we decided to try something for dessert.  We went with the Cinnamon Roll with Pecans  (I think they call it a Schneiken?).  It was so good.

We left there full and content.

It was a no brainer where we were going to breakfast today- right back to Our Daily Bread.

The ciabatta bread is to die for, I had that with my omelette today. Their Rye bread is also top notch.

The employees are warm and friendly.  Really a nice crew.

The prices are a bit high, but its Santa Barbara so its to be expected. Breakfast for two was just under $30.00 the first day and $28 the second day.  That was without the extra treats we bought after breakfast.  I adore carrot cake, but would not recommend the one they sell here.  The texture of the cake was odd- it was actually ""squishy"" and wet when you bit into it. 

I understand they are very busy on the weekends but since we will be up there one more day, we might just brave the crowds so we can have one more fix of this terrific place.",2014/5/10 1:21

I had the three egg omelette with mushroom, spinach, and tomatoes. With some greens with a homemade vinaigrette dressing. Topped with a healthy portion of avocados. I bite into it and the freshness was evident in the firm veggies. Their multi grain toast was homemade and complimented the omelette well. I just needed to add a ""punch"" of pepper :) 

My breakfast partner ordered the Veggie breakfast burrito with egg whites. It came with cheese and fresh salsa. Well made put together burrito. Again I use this word, but I mean it people. It tasted fresh!! Veggies were good. Most importantly it was light.

Definitely a huge addition and asset to the De La Vina food scene. It's an amazing bakery with two epic bonuses: 1) they serve breakfast and lunch with quick, simple, but delicious items at reasonable prices & 2) (my favorite part) they have a la marzocco espresso machine and they know how to use it!!! Simply put: their lattes, cappuccinos, macchiatos, or any other steam pulled hot drinks are PERFECT. Something to be said for the old school way of hand steaming your milk and if you don't believe me taste test one of their lattes against a machine steamed one from Starbucks or coffee bean. 
Enough on coffee though, it's a bakery first and foremost and the selection is pretty robust. Baguettes, loaves, rolls, pastries, croissants, cookies.... It's all delicious and the staff are an epic part to ODB's success. They've certainly made a regular out of me!",2013/10/5 18:19

Service was great. The selection of bread is a carb lover's heaven (SO MUCH SAMPLES TOO). All of it is super affordable too! A freshly baked french baguette was only $2.95! They had smaller herb rolls, ciabatta breads, etc. (a la carte) for 40- 60 cents. 

Farmer's Market Salad was light and near perfection. 
     - the lemon herb vinaigrette made in house is to die for. 
     - a nice ratio of candied pecans, crusted brie, pears, and butternut squash

Smoked Salmon Benedict
     - OMG. BEST BENEDICT IVE HAD. 
     - On their homemade toast instead of English muffin
     - The eggs were poached just right.

Anyways, you can come in and simply buy some bread loaves or baguettes for your dinner, or if you want to dine in/out they have an incredibly fresh and local menu! I recommend their chicken pesto on sourdough! it was delicious!

I usually drink a double red-eye, which isn't hard to make but you really get to taste the espresso.  

If I could change one thing about this place it would be the weekend hours. Personal opinion here, but coffee-shops should never open any later than 6am on any given day ;)

In addition to their nude ryes, wheats, sourdoughs, and more, ODB's ciabatta makes a perfectly good nest for veggie burgers, and since they are also offered in bulk supply, I no longer buy burger buns at the grocery store. Once I was even lucky enough to stumble in on a day the bakers made challah buns hotdog style which were yummy and bag free -- thank you ODB.",2013/9/16 23:01

Pancakes
French toast

Turkey Egg bacon croissant

The new space is in a nice area of De La Vina Street. There is outdoor patio seating where you can sit in the sun or shade. The inside is a little noisy but still decent.

Ah...the smell of fresh baked bread, there's nothing like it!

I had the hot Chicken Pesto Sandwich on a roll. This was a tasty sandwich with the pesto not being too overpowering of the other ingredients. The chicken was moist and tender and the roll was fresh with just enough crunch.

My dining companions had the Gobbler and a half salad with chicken. Since there was no bread brought with the salad I simply went up and got a couple of the free slices that they offer. Problem solved for her!

The sandwiches come with a small salad with nice greens and tomatoes. 

This place suffers only from the standard, inflated, Santa Barbara pricing but the portions were ample.

Hi Egberto! You weren't there today but hope to see you around.",2015/2/15 23:36

I had the Greek Salad the other day:  all top quality ingredients, fresh and local.  The carob-apricot squares are to die for, and I'm a total I-love-chocolate-and-would-not-touch-carob type!  Breads can't be beat.  Try the German Rye - so tangy it will make you pucker.  And it is impossible anywhere in the Tri-Counties to get a better challah.  The place is not perfect, though.  I acknowledge that the staff, though friendly, helpful, and delightful in almost every way, may not be as efficient as some of the zealous and busy might wish.

After eating it the verdict is really great. Omelette was spot on. The Banh mi was great, could of used a little more flavor and filling. Bread was delicious. Cranberries on the gobbler were extremely tart and made my mouth dance after the savory turkey bacon in my omelette. Then all that was left to try was the tuna. Fresh and basic.

I had just been in San Francisco and had crazy good toast at The Mill. There's really no one doing toast in So Cal except for here. Huge thick pieces of toast served with fresh ground peanut butter and homemade strawberry preserves. Seriously - this whopping piece of toast was enough for 2 people. 

I know they supply a number of local restaurants with their bread but it's great to stop in here and pick up a loaf for yourself at home. In the mornings, they often have a selection of their fresh loaves cut up for you to sample. Fantastic!!",2015/4/27 3:46
